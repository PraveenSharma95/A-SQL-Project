** Challenges and Learnings**

o The main challenge posed by this project was to extract the data from CSVs into MYSQL Server as while importing 
  and changing the data format, the data was unable to get loaded, so as a solution I worked on Microsoft SQL Server, 
  where the data got loaded in fractions of time.
  
o Another challenge which I faced was to manage the time as It was very difficult to deliver the project in 
  three days along with my work.

o I learnt about what all factors and KPIs can contribute for the business growth.
